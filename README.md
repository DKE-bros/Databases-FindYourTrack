# Databases-FindYourTrack
Songs Database Project
It has certainly already happened to many of you to want to create a playlist of music that suits your mood. Whether it’s for a certain style of music, a particular artist or a specific period of time, you’ll find what you’re looking for. Because this database system is made for those who wish to escape through music or to become blind-test professionals.
Being passionate about music for several years now, it was important for me to be able to provide a database that could help many people to discover the music they want.
In order to solve this problem in the widest possible sense, many nice features had to be thought of to make the database as useful as possible. It must be able to take into account, for example, the possibility of being able to find a series of music titles from a pop artist. But also to be capable of identifying several artists who have collaborated with a producer you particularly like. These are just a few examples that can be done using the database.
